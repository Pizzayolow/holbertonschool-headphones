🖥️ A Web Page implementation from scratch

HTML CSS

🧐 Project Overview

Welcome to the "Web Page Implementation from Scratch" project! In this exercise, Figma will be your guide as you embark on the journey of translating a web designer's file into a fully functional web page. This project aims to simulate real-world scenarios you might encounter in a company or startup, where collaboration with designers and accurate implementation of their work is crucial.
🎓 Project Guidelines

    Freedom in Implementation: You have the liberty to implement the web page as you see fit. The primary objective is to achieve a fully functional web page that mirrors the designer's file.

    Foundation Building: Establish strong foundations by:
        Resetting CSS styling
        Using variables
        Employing simple and generic CSS selectors
        Minimizing the use of highly specific CSS selectors
        Adhering to a straightforward HTML structure with div containers

    Implementation Approach: Consider building the web page from the outside to the inside and from top to bottom. This approach can enhance the overall development process.

📚 Project Requirements

    CSS Framework: Do not import external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
    JavaScript: Avoid the use of JavaScript in this implementation.

☝️ Advice

Building a web page the right way is challenging, but it forms a crucial skill in your professional journey. Engage in discussions with designers, implement their vision, and be prepared for their reviews. The skills you develop in this project will prove invaluable in your future collaborations.
